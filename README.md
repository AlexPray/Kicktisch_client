# Work in progress
### introduction
I recently started this project. It will be an animated mobile-first football table website

<br>

#### Figma Design: https://www.figma.com/file/2rgTHj1EKQ8ZHRo26OWB9Q/Kicktisch-Screendesign?node-id=295%3A317&t=1I2OWgA4CJBfuFi0-0
There is a draft and main page in my figma file. The lower frames on the main page are the definitive 4 mobile and desktop designs

<br>

### development plan

**DevStack:** React, Express, MongoDB, PayloadCMS,

**Tools/Librarys:** Tailwind CSS, GSAP(animation), Webstorm, ?Docker(for learning purpose), Redux

**V1.0** Will be a simple React Website working with PayloadCMS

**V2.0** implemented animations with GSAP

**V3.0** implemented Cart with help of Redux and dockerize the project


<br>

### Challenges during this project

- Payload CMS was released in early 2021 hence there isn't much content out there except the official documentation to help me with possible issues.
  I will still try to make it work and if I manage this, I will learn a lot


- Most animations aren't too difficult to implement, but I have some complicated ideas like letting the ball from the Logo fall down the display while scrolling and get kicked left and right by the football figure


- This will be the first time I work with Tailwind CSS and i am excited to learn this CSS framework.
